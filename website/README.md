If I had more time, I would refactor my website code to 
use my Querier class to connect to Neo4j instead of tightly
coupling the queries with my Dash website. I uploaded the
beginnings of a Querier class and a website.py version called
website_WIP.py that uses it, but I decided to prioritize 
interview prep over debugging it.
